              Content creation bottlenecks swell up when a <br /> marketing team
              relies too much on a small group of <br /> specialized pros to
              produce a large volume of video <br /> content. Instead, put the
              freedom of video creation <br />
              directly into the hands of all your teams while <br /> ensuring
              brand control and watch your content library <br /> multiply.

              online distribution. <br />
              Multiply the content you already have and work <br /> smarter, not
              harder.
